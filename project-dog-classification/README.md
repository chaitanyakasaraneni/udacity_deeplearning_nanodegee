## Project Overview

This project is done as a part of Convolutional Neural Networks course in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, this implementation will make important design decisions about the user experience for the app.
