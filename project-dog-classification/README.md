## Project Overview

This project is done as a part of Convolutional Neural Networks course in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, this implementation will make important design decisions about the user experience for the app.

### Dataset
* You can download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in this project's home directory, at the location `/dog_images`. 

* Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location `/lfw`.  

*Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder.*
