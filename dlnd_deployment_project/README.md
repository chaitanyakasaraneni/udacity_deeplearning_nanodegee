# SageMaker Deployment Project

This project is done as a part of Deployment course of Udacity's Deep Learning Nano Degree and focuses on 'AWS Sagemaker Deployment' of a Sentiment Analysis model using RNN. 
A simple web app which interacts with the deployed RNN to provide the results of sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

</p>

The original code (question) can be found on [Udacity's SageMaker Deployment repository](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment).

#### Prerequisites
This project assumes that the developer has some familiarity with SageMaker, the IMDB Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost mini-project (which can be found in the original repository).

#### Setup instructions
Please see the [README of original repository](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) 
for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files. 
For the solutions, clone this repository:

```
cd SageMaker
git clone https://github.com/chaitanyakasaraneni/udacity_deeplearning_nanodegee.git
exit
```

After downloading navigate into the folder named ```dlnd_deployment_project```

#### Web app final result

The final project will be executed in a simple HTML page which can be deployed anywhere. 

You will see the following:
