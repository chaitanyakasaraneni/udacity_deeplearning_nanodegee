## Project Overview

This project is done as a part of Generative Adversarial Networks course in Udacity's Deep Learning Nano Degree
In this project, a DCGAN was defined and trained on a dataset of faces. The goal was to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, the results of generator are visualized to see how it performs. The generated samples look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [CelebA dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/November/5be7eb6f_processed-celeba-small/processed-celeba-small.zip). This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN) so deeper networks were defined and trained for a longer time to get good results.
