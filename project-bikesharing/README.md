## Project Overview

This project is done as a part of Neural Networks course in Udacity's Deep Learning Nano Degree.

In this project, we explore how to build a neural netwoek from scratch to carry out predictions on a real world bike sharing dataset.
Through this project one can have better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools.
